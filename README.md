# UNet-ResNet-based-3DLSI
This is the trained models for 3D laser speckle imaging, using UNet for vessel segmentation and ResNet for depth estimation.

We provide a Jupyter Notebook in the main directory and attached the models and validation dataset in the releases.

Future updates will be on dynamic speckle image generation and depth-dependent speckle contrast model.
